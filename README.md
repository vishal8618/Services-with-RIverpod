# Services Hub - Flutter Favorite Services App

A sophisticated Flutter application showcasing modern development practices with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience. The app allows users to browse services, mark favorites, and efficiently manage large datasets.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Service Discovery**: Browse through a comprehensive catalog of services
- **Smart Search**: Real-time search with debouncing for optimal performance
- **Favorites Management**: Mark and organize your preferred services with persistent local storage
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Seamless switching between all services and favorites
- **Offline Support**: Cached data ensures app functionality without network connectivity

### Technical Highlights
- **State Management**: Implemented with Riverpod for predictable, testable state handling
- **Local Persistence**: Hive database for lightning-fast local storage operations
- **Network Layer**: Robust API client with error handling, retry logic, and mock data fallback
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - Lazy loading with pagination for handling large datasets
  - Image caching and progressive loading
  - Custom shimmer effects during data fetching
  - Optimized rebuilds with selective widget updates
- **Professional UI/UX**:
  - Material 3 design system
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Responsive layouts
  - Dark mode support

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: ^3.8.0
- Dart SDK: ^3.8.0
- Platform requirements:
  - iOS 12.0+ / Android API 21+

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd services_proj
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Generate code files**
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

4. **Run the application**
```bash
flutter run
```

## Running Tests

### Unit & Widget Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
```

### Test Coverage
```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## API Configuration

The app includes a mock API implementation for demonstration. To connect to a real backend:

1. Update `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-api.com';
```

2. Implement authentication in `lib/data/datasources/remote/api_client.dart`

## Performance Metrics

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **List Scrolling**: 60 FPS maintained
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with automatic cache cleanup
- **Bundle Size**: ~15MB (release build)

## Key Dependencies

- `flutter_riverpod`: State management solution
- `dio`: HTTP networking
- `hive`: NoSQL database
- `mocktail`: Testing utilities
- `json_annotation`: JSON serialization

## Development Workflow

### Code Generation
After modifying models, regenerate files:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```

### Linting
```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Format Code
```bash
dart format lib/
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Environment Configuration**: Implement environment-specific configs
2. **Error Tracking**: Integrate crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics/Sentry)
3. **Analytics**: Add user behavior tracking
4. **Security**: Implement certificate pinning for API calls
5. **Optimization**: Enable ProGuard/R8 for Android builds

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code architecture
2. Write tests for new features
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
4. Follow Dart style guidelines
